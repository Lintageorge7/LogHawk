## INTRODUCTION

Log analysis plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by helping detect Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), respond to threats early, and secure critical systems. This project introduces **LogHawk**, a lightweight log monitoring tool built using Python and Bash, designed to automate the detection of common suspicious activities in logs such as brute-force attacks, system failures, and unauthorized script executions. Log monitoring is critical in detecting early Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as failed SSH attempts, which can indicate brute-force attacks (MITRE ATT&CK, 2024).

The motivation for this tool stems from the need to equip security teams with a simple, customizable, and open-source log scanning solution that can scale with diverse infrastructure and be easily scheduled and extended.

### SOLUTIONS SECTION

**Overview**

LogHawk includes two scripts:

- loghawk.py: a Python-based flexible log parser
- loghawk.sh: a Bash-based quick filter scanner

These scripts analyze logs from sources like auth.log, access.log, and system.log.

**üêç Python Script: loghawk.py**

**Functions:**

- Detect multiple failed SSH login attempts (potential brute-force)
- Identify critical system errors (ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Flag cron jobs running suspicious commands like wget, curl

**Usage:**

python3 loghawk.py sample_logs/auth.log

**Sample Output:**

The script‚Äôs failed login detection aligns with MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1110 for Brute Force (MITRE, 2024).

**üíª Bash Script: loghawk.sh**

**Functions:**

- Uses grep to scan for failed logins, system errors, and cron activity

**Usage:**

./loghawk.sh sample_logs/system.log

## Sample Output:  

<img width="614" height="155" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ebcf6b2-782e-42eb-a0fd-296c543b55c1" />

The script output indicates a potential privilege escalation event, where user3 initiated a root shell using sudo (COMMAND=/bin/bash). Such activity is often scrutinized in cybersecurity monitoring due to its potential use in post-exploitation or lateral movement scenarios (MITRE, n.d.). Monitoring sudo commands, especially those invoking interactive shells, is a common security best practice (NIST, 2020).

üõ°Ô∏è Security implication: This could indicate privilege escalation, especially if user3 shouldn't be running interactive root shells.

**‚è≤ Automation Setup**

**Linux Cron Job:**

\*/10 \* \* \* \* /home/student/LogHawk/loghawk.sh /var/log/auth.log

**Windows Task Scheduler:**

- Program: python
- Arguments: C:\\path\\to\\loghawk.py C:\\logs\\auth.log
- Trigger: Every 10 minutes

#### POTENTIAL ITERATIONS

To enhance LogHawk:

- üìß Add email alerting and threshold-based escalation
- üìä Support JSON/CSV output for integration with SIEM tools
- üíª Create a simple web dashboard for visualization
- üîó Integrate with ELK stack, Splunk, or Syslog
- üìä Add live monitoring support with socket or file watch

#### Conclusion

LogHawk is a foundational log monitoring tool that demonstrates core cybersecurity skills such as scripting, log parsing, automation, and IoC awareness. It provides actionable insights for system defenders and can serve as a building block for more advanced threat detection systems. Its open-source nature encourages collaboration and continuous improvement from the security community.
